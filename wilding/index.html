                    Once we were camping at the lake, before the city came in and made "official" campsites with concrete parking and metal fire rings. Back then, the wardens told us, "You can camp wherever you think you're big enough." We found a place close to the water with enough clearing to pitch the tent. We found a magic in the summer twilight watching the sunset reflected in the water. The air held cicada music, and even the mesquite trees seemed to lean in closer like a hug.

                    Another time, we left the food out too long. As we sat around the campfire, we heard the tell-tale crinkling of plastic. I jumped up and turned to see a bushy gray and black tail flip out of the trash bag and onto the ground. When critters get curious, that's a sure signal that it's time to get things put away. Sure enough, our bushy-tailed friend hid behind a tree and showed themself again when the trash bag went away. It took some shooing away with the business end of a hot dog stick to make sure they knew they weren't welcome.

                   As students of theology, we arise at the end of this practice to offer a prayer and a blessing on both the Earth and her inhabitants. We acknowledge the growth we've experienced by examining the current climate crisis through multiple religious traditions. We've felt grief, but interwoven in our prayer, we'll share multiple examples of what we've learned from others and ourselves. These lessons will move us forward, we encourage you to join us.

Seeking forgiveness seems insufficient, so we ask for assistance as we make amends.<BR>

                   We may not be able to stop climate change, but can we show the earth we love her and help protect the living nature without moving to the middle of the woods and eating tree bark for every meal? Here are some bitesize actions you can do by the end of the week, the end of the month, and the end of the year that actually make a difference!


        
               </div>
               
               <div class="text">
                   <B>Week</b>
                   <ul>
                     <li><B><i>Talk more about it.</i></b> Studies show that 70%-80% of people recognize climate change but many of those people never talk about it. People may have anxiety about it, or they assume they are isolated in feeling strongly about the environment. Simply talking about climate change with those around you has been shown to elevate anxiety and lead to more action. </li>
                     <li><B><i>Pick up trash when you are walking.</i></b> Okay, sure. This isn't going to single-handedly fix anything, but each piece of garbage that doesn't end up in an animal habitat is notable. </li>
                      <li><B><i>Walk a little more, drive a little less.</i></b> Just walking to your local coffee shop instead of driving two miles prevents approximately 850 mL of carbon from going into the air. That's more than two 12-ounce bottles of carbon dioxide you kept out of the air. </li>
                   <li><B><i>Continue to educate yourself.</i></b> There are plenty of books to read or have around or even just follow more creators spreading the news about climate change and what's being done about it. If you are overwhelmed about where to start a good book: Drawdown, a podcast to listen to: TED Climate, and an Instagram account to follow: itsthegarbagequeen- Alaina Wood. These aren't everything but they are a great start!
</li>
                     <li><B><i>Less food waste.</i></b> Food waste in landfills emits 4x more methane than anything else in a landfill, and methane is 4x more potent than any other greenhouse gas. By sticking to grocery lists, using all of what you have before buying more, freezing and canning and strategically planning how much you buy, you can eliminate more greenhouse gas emissions than you create, and doing this can even help with the world hunger crisis.
                         </li>
                     </ul>
                   <BR>
                   <b>Month</b>
                   <ul>
                     <li><B><i>Swap for more low-waste options at a local refill shop.</i></b> Shampoo out? Toothbrush gross? Use the last of your laundry detergent? Swap it! Many local grocery stores now carry lower waste alternatives like shampoo bars or bamboo toothbrushes. If you live in a city, there is probably a refill shop nearby where you can use leftover jars or bottles to pick up typical household items. These refill shops typically are locally owned, low carbon or carbon neutral, and the products often last longer than your average product while costing about the same. If getting to a refill shop is too much for you right now, switch to lower-waste options at a grocery store!</li>
                    <li><B><i>Swap to more plant-based options for food.</i></b> You may not be able (or want) to be vegetarian or vegan, but if you eat meat for every meal, try a meatless meal once or twice a week. Drawdown, a book created by a group of climate scientists to give the top 100 solutions to climate change, lists a plant-rich diet as the fourth most effective way to help reduce your environmental footprint.</li>
                      <li><B><i>Repurpose and refresh.</i></b> We all want homes that look nice and not like we threw it together, but following trends and replacing furniture or clothes every time styles change takes a toll on Mother Earth. Try to paint or restain the things in your house that don't inspire you anymore instead of buying new. The same goes for clothes. Try mending them before throwing them out when they get minor holes and tears. Dye them when they get stains. If all of that fails, find a locally owned thrift shop to find new things and try to repurpose things you're getting rid of. Can you use the fabric from that shirt for a patch on a pair of pants? Could the wood for that table be used to fix up the broken bookshelf? Or try to give it away on places like Facebook marketplace or buy-nothing groups for someone else to repurpose!</li>

              <b>Year</b>
              <ul>
                  
                  <li><B><I>Vote!</i></b> Nothing will be happen at large scales until people start turning their political and economic focus to climate change. Voting in local, state, and national elections with the environment in mind and advocating for others around you to do the same can lead to real changes on bigger scales than just you! </li>
                <li><B><i>Start composting.</i></b> Some cities like Denver have city composts you can pay for and the city will pick it up. Other cities don't have this resource, so you might start your own. Talk to some other friends or join Facebook Groups who want to do more about starting one together or finding a local organization that will help! </li>
                 <li><B><I>Invest in companies that are focused on the environment.</b></i> Once again no actual change is going to happen if it is not economical. Many investing apps now have investment options in companies that operate with the environment in mind. The more we invest in the companies that are trying to reduce their carbon footprints, the more other large companies will follow suit. </li>
                 <li><B><I>Shop locally or at grocery stores that aren't funding things hurting the environment.</b></u> Many big-name grocery stores are some of the worst when it comes to environmental impact. Try to shop at places that are locally focused and environmentally conscious.</li>
                <li><B><I>Advocate for changes around you.</b></i> Does your work recycle? Does your school use a lot of paper for things that could be digital? Does your church use a big company coffee when they could use a local roaster? Does your work turn off all the lights and computers at the end of the day? Figure out when the spaces around you could make minor changes and advocate for those things to make a difference.</li>
